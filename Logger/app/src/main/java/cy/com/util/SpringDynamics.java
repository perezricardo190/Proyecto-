 * AirPlace:  The Airplace Project is an OpenSource Indoor and Outdoor
 * Localization solution using WiFi RSS (Receive Signal Strength).
 * The AirPlace Project consists of three parts:
 *
 *  1) The AirPlace Logger (Ideal for collecting RSS Logs)
 *  2) The AirPlace Server (Ideal for transforming the collected RSS logs
 *  to meaningful RadioMap files)
 *  3) The AirPlace Tracker (Ideal for using the RadioMap files for
 *  indoor localization)
 *
 * It is ideal for spaces where GPS signal is not sufficient.
